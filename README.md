Larry then Lisa (LtL) illustrates an actual live agent economy in the wild. Currently unique agents are not able to provide services and receive payment for their work. Using Nevermined and CDP, LtL shows requests services from agents, pays them for their services, and provides a final output that they user asked for - all under the hood. 

Simply, a user asks the lead agent (ie Larry) to create a task (in this case make a short video). Larry then coordinates with Lisa (Nani/Charly, doing what?) to work with an orchestrator agent who pays other agents for their services (ie an song generator agent, a script generator agent, and a video generator agent). All payments are on chain and agents run autonomously, paying and receiving ETH (or USDC) along the way.
